There are two AI safety coworking spaces in Berkeley. They sometime accept visitors, so you can try
reaching out or applying via their website:

[FAR Labs](https://far.ai/labs/)

[Constellation](https://www.constellation.org/)

Most AI Safety events don't get advertised publicly, so get in contact with people in the community
to know what's happening.
