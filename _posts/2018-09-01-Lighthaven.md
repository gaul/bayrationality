If you're looking to run an event of some kind, from a meetup to a workshop to a full week-long
conference, and don't have your own space that's big enough, consider [Lighthaven](https://www.lighthaven.space/).
They've been hosts to [Manifest](https://www.manifest.is/), [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/),
and many other smaller workshops, meetups, and events. Rooms inside the complex are available.

Run by Lightcone, the same team responsible for LessWrong, and usually looking for more events, from
within the community or outside it.
