To find spots in group houses, temporary or long term, you can use the [Bay Area EA/Rationality
Housing Board](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2266502166822026/).  The [EA Houses spreadsheet
](https://coda.io/d/EA-Houses_dePaxf_RJiq/EA-Houses-couchsurfing-renting-to-give_suGq6#_lurkc) also
has some entries in the Bay.

It probably works best to ask people in the Bay if they know of housing opportunities, as lots of
housing is provided peer-to-peer. Starting with local meetup organizers for a nearby neighborhood
may be a good idea.
