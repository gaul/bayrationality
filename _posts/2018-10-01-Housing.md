To find spots in group houses, temporary or long term, you can use the [Bay Area EA/Rationality
Housing Board](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2266502166822026/).  The [EA Houses spreadsheet
](https://coda.io/d/EA-Houses_dePaxf_RJiq/EA-Houses-couchsurfing-renting-to-give_suGq6#_lurkc) also
has some entries in the Bay. [Lighthaven](https://www.lighthaven.space/) sometimes has space free
for short-term rentals, but it's primarily an events space and conferences take priority.

It probably works best to ask people in the Bay if they know of housing opportunities, as lots of
housing is provided peer-to-peer. Starting with local meetup organizers for a nearby neighborhood
may be a good idea.
