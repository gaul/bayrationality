Probably the longest-running organized event in the Bayesian Area, the Bayesian Choir is open to
anyone who can pitch-match and meets every other Sunday in the general North Oakland-Berkeley area.
See [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/rfPYGCV) and [the introduction
doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rwmwx6lOhzWgWPtrX3EWMXmJqNpQpHtqRYMbicDTGj8/edit) if you're
interested in joining, and direct questions to Choir Director Blake Jones. 

Performance rehearsals for Secular Solstice begin in the fall, with the choir meeting every Sunday.
This is usually not a good time to join, but in other parts of the year anyone's welcome to try it
for a few weeks, even without experience. Give it a shot!
