If you want to discover the EA community, the [EA's Guide to Berkeley and The Bay Area](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/W2w7xA9AtDnjcK6DP/an-ea-s-guide-to-berkeley-and-the-bay-area_) and the [SF Bay Area EA website](https://sfbayea.org/) are great resources. They both have more links to local groups and other resources, and you can [register to the email newsletter](https://sfbayea.org/getinvolved).

Events sometimes get advertised on those websites:

[East Bay EA Hangout](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ebeah/) on Facebook
